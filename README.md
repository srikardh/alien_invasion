Alien Invasion lets the player control a rocket ship at the bottom of the screen, moving left or right and shooting aliens. Fleets move across and down the screen. Clearing all aliens creates a faster fleet. If an alien hits the ship or reaches the bottom, a life is lost. Losing three lives ends the game.
